  "about_content": "Hi, my name is Jonas, and I am a trained medical biologist with a focus on bioinformatics, data science and with a strong interest for web technologies - in alphabetical order. During my studies, I developed an interest in analyzing next-generation sequencing data, which involves extensive data handling and computer-assisted analysis. Consequently, I learned coding in Python and R.<br>Alongside my studies, I also started experimenting with web technologies, because I was and still am interested in how dynamic content is served to the client and how components like reverse proxies, caching, webservers, databases etc interplay. Because, CMSs like Drupal or WordPress left me unsatisfied in that regard, I started to dig into Django and build my first toy project - which was aggregator.<br> More recently, I have delved into Java with Spring for robust backend development and JavaScript, React and Next.js primarily for front-end web development. Using JavaScript and React, I built this CV. My current project, Iron Delirium™ – The Workout Tracker that no one asked for - is build using Spring Boot/Security in the backend and Next.js/React in the front-end.",
