  "about_content": "Hi, my name is Jonas, and I am a trained medical biologist with a focus on bioinformatics, data science and with a strong interest for web technologies - in alphabetical order. During my studies, I developed an interest in analyzing next-generation sequencing data, which involves extensive data handling and computer-assisted analysis. Consequently, I learned coding in Python and R.<br>Alongside my studies, I also started experimenting with web technologies, because I was and still am interested in how dynamic content is served to the client and how components like reverse proxies, caching, webservers, databases etc interplay. Because, CMSs like Drupal or WordPress left me unsatisfied in that regard, I started to dig into Django and build my first toy project - which was a news aggregator.<br> More recently, I have delved into Java with Spring as backend development platform and JavaScript, React and Next.js primarily for front-end use.<br> This CV is built using React and jekyll. My current project, Iron Delirium™ – The Workout Tracker that no one asked for - is build using Spring Boot/Security in the backend and Next.js/React in the front-end.<br>I like bouldering, a bit of fitness, DnD, going to concerts and festivals as well as hanging out with friends and family.",
